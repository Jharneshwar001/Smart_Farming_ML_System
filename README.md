# Smart_Farming_ML_System
Developed SmartFarm Yield Forecaster using Python, leveraging pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib to predict crop yields based on environmental factors. This model utilizes a Random Forest Regressor and incorporates time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA and Prophet to capture complex relationships between time-dependent variables and crop yield. Key features include engineered time-based variables to enhance predictive accuracy. A DataPreprocessor class was implemented for data cleaning and outlier management, while exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed critical trends and correlations, providing actionable insights for optimized farming practices.
